A digital art course might be pretty fun. Or a course where you can make your own video games.
Really any course that is creative in an art sense combined with computer science would be neat.
A class that would be cool is where you can combine some artisic skills with computer skills to make
something unique like, maybe a class in animation where you learn how to animate short clips (like sprites).
